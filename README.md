## About

Moodify enables the user to create a unique playlist using the Spotify API. Based on the mood input provides by the user, a playlist will be created in real time which will be automatically stored on the connected Spotify account. Additionally the app creates a mood graph based on the users recently played tracks.

Moodify was coded as our Final Project at Ironhack Berlin's Coding Bootcamp. [Lindsay](https://github.com/L-Wilson "Lindsay"), [Anjali](https://github.com/anjapatel "Anjali") and [Nele](https://github.com/L-Wilson "Nele") ate a lot of chocolate while coding this page in 9 days. &hearts;
