# MOODIFY | Ironhack Coding Bootcamp Final Project

Moodify enables the user to create a unique playlist using the Spotify API. Based on the mood input provides by the user, a playlist will be created in real time which will be automatically stored on the connected Spotify account. Additionally the app creates a mood graph based on the users recently played tracks.
